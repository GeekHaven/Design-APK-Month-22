”A Mentor Scheduling App, where you can schedule meeting with a Mentor for any skillset that you need to learn or improve”


The task comprises three parts:

1. **Splash Screen** - It is the screen that briefly appears when you launch the app, contains the logo of a the app and sometimes the name of the app too. You have to design a single splash screen for the above app, use your creativity and graphic designing skills for the same.
Tip: Start working on this screen after the graphic design workshop on 20th February, till then you can work on the other two screens for the meantime.

2. **Home Screen** - Pretty self explanatory. Design a visually appealing and intuitive home screen for the above app.

3.  **Third Screen** - Make another screen/section for the app which you think is the second most important section for the app to function after the home screen. Use your discretion to decide which section out of the remaining holds maximum importance and implement it using your design skills.


Submit the link to the figma file containing both the screens in .txt file and place the file in the “Designare” Folder only.
