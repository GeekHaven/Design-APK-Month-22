It is the second most important screen in my app because when a user is searching for a mentor in home
screen and want to know more details about the mentor and schedule a meet with him/her  it will take the user
to the screen where all the info about the mentor is available 
like the available slots in which he can schedule the meet,chat with the mentor and connect with the mentor on social media 
platforms ,can read reviews and his/her experience.
