This is the 3rd screen which i consider to be the most important screen after the home screen.
This screen depicts the recommended mentors after the user selects a particular skill that he/she wants to learn.
This screen also allows the user to send request to the mentor from whom the user wants to learn.
After the request is accepted by the mentor, the user can select the date and time of the meeting.
And after that finally a meeting link is generated so that the user can join the meeting at that particular time.
